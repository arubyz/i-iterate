= 1. The top-level forms driving the iteration =

Drivers are the s-expressions that describe iterative tasks. They usually begin with the prefix, that describes the purpose of the driver, which then can be followed by either the variables this driver operates on, the symbols that describe details about the action performed by the driver, and, some times the datum.

Example:

`(for i in '(1 2 3 4) by #'cddr)`

`for` is the prefix, which describes the selection of the driver. `in` and `by` are the symbols that specify how exactly the driver should function (`in` means it should iterate over `car`s and `by` means it should use the following datum for selecting the next list cell.) `i` is a variable of this driver. Variables record the state of the iteration. In this example, `i` would be set to 1 and 3. `#'cddr` is the datum, in the context of this driver it is treated as a function to select the next list cell.

*List of available drivers*

|| [Iterate_2#initially • initially] ||  || A driver that runs before any code in the iteration. ||
|| [Iterate_3#finally • finally] ||  || A driver that runs when the iteration finishes normally. ||
|| [Iterate_4#for • for] ||  || A multi-purpose driver for doing variety of things. ||
|| [Iterate_5#generate • generate] ||  || A general purpose generator driver. ||
|| [Iterate_6#repeat • repeat] ||  || A simple driver for performing iteration N number of items. ||
|| [Iterate_7#with • with] ||  || A driver for variable declaration. ||
