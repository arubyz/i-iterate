= 2. The forms available inside the iteration =

These forms may serve various purposes, which can be grouped as follows:

`accumulators`

Forms that accumulate values produced by a driver, `collect`, `hash`, `output`, `insert` and `reduce` belong in this group.

`control flow`

Forms that affect how the iteration is performed. They can “fast-forward” it or retrieve a value from the previous state etc. `return`, `skip`, `previous` and `next` belong in this group.

`counting`

This group performs arithmetic on subsequent states of the iteration. `sum`, `multiply`, `maximize`, `minimize` and `count` all belong in this group.

|| [Iterate_9#return • return] ||  || Returns the control flow to the form outside the loop. ||
|| [Iterate_10#collect • collect] ||  || Generates a list with the cells being the expression given. ||
|| [Iterate_11#hash • hash] ||  || Generates a hash-table with the provided keys and values. ||
|| [Iterate_12#skip • skip] ||  || Skips the execution of the rest of the loop body. ||
|| [Iterate_13#previous • previous] ||  || Gives the value of the variable from the previous iteration. ||
|| [Iterate_14#next • next] ||  || Gives the value of the variable from the next iteration. ||
|| [Iterate_15#output • output] ||  || Prints the variable to the dedicated stream. ||
|| [Iterate_16#insert • insert] ||  || Generates a vector and inserts elements into it. ||
|| [Iterate_17#maximize • maximize] ||  || Finds the laregest value of the variable. ||
|| [Iterate_18#minimize • minimize] ||  || Finds the smallest value of the variable. ||
|| [Iterate_19#count • count] ||  || Counts the number to times this expression was executed. ||
|| [Iterate_20#sum • sum] ||  || Sums the values of this variable. ||
|| [Iterate_21#multiply • multiply] ||  || Multiplies the values of this variable. ||
|| [Iterate_22#reduce • reduce] ||  || General purpose accumulation handler. ||
