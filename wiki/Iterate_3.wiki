== 1.2 Runs the epilogue code ==

This driver is executed after the iteration had finished in a regular way. The syntax of this driver is `(finally EXPRESSION)` where EXPRESSION is any Lisp code.

||  || {{{ (++ (for i from 1 to 10 by 3)   (message "i: %s" i)   (finally (message "i: %s" (* i 2)))) }}} ||

This example will print “1, 4, 7, 10, 26”
