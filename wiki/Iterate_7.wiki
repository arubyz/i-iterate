== 1.6 Variable declaration ==

This driver is very similar to `let*` in effect. It allows you to declare variables you can use later inside other drivers. It can be particularly useful when you need to initialize the variables you are collecting into with some values, before the first collection can occur.

||  || {{{ (++ (with ((a (let ((x 0))                  (map 'vector (lambda (y) (+ y (incf x)))                      (make-vector 10 0))))            (b 100) c))   (for i across a)   (message "b - i: %s, c: %s" (- b i) c)) }}} ||

This example initializes the variable `a` to be an array of a length of 100 and loops over the values in the created array.
